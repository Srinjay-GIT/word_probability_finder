# word_probability_finder
This program uses Markov chain to find out the next most probable words after taking a word or phrase as input. There are 3 state models. 1st one uses the last word of the phrase to determine the next word, 2nd one uses the last 2 words and the 3rd one uses last 3 words. The model is trained on a csv file containing large number of news headlines.
